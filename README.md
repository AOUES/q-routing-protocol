# Q-Routing-Protocol


To get this to work run:
```
make clean
make
./netsim1
```

##Learning types
To change between "Q-learning" and SARSA go to netsim1.h and change learntype to VL or SARSA (don't ask about the VL thing haha)


##Input Networks  
We have two different input graphs 6x6.net and lata.net (both are described in the paper), you can change those in netsim1.h as well.

##Other Shit
The standalone files are helper files written by the original author. (to whom credit will be given as we complete more of this :) )
