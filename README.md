# Q-Routing-Protocol


To get this to work run:

make clean
make
./netsim1


To change between "Q-learning" and SARSA go to netsim1.h and change learntype to VL or SARSA (don't ask about the VL thing haha)



We have two different input graphs 6x6.net and lata.net (both are described in the paper), you can change those in netsim1.h as well.

The standalone files are helper files written by the original author. (to whom credit will be given as we complete more of this :) )
