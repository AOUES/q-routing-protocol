# CPE 400 Final Project

This is the Python source file for our simulator and agents.

To run this code simply choose and agent file (currently we have Q learning and SARSA) and run:

```
python do_TYPE_learning.py
```
so for instance, to run the Q learning agent, type

```
python do_q_learning.py
```

in this directory.


The agent's performance is written to the console.
